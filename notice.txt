TRAINING:
DetectorLoader.py =>
     config_file : carefully the path
     weight_file : carefully the path
     conf_thres : confidence for the Action
main_fast_inference.py =>
    weights_file : carefully the path
Data/create_dataset_1.py (create the excel and show the video[for typing the action to label for any frame])
    class_names : fill your all action 
    press A and D : you can towrad or backward the screen
    fill up the all label , restart the pose will show up the class_names by label
Data/create_dataset_2.py (catch the skeleton by video , that will create the excel automatically)
    pose_estimator = SPPE_FastPose() : can choose which alphapose skeleton
    bb : if machine can not realize it will typing 0 will not enter to the excel
Data/create_dataset_3.py (create the pkl file by itself , and copy this one rename "Coffee_room_new-set(labelXscrw)" , I didn't reseach what both of means)
Actionsrecognition\train.py =>
    device : choose what you wanna use gpu(cuda) or cpu 
    class_names : not important
    num_class : have to the same size with actions what you build by above 
    ##actor said visualizer not using, so mark all about that and motions_map not using at all




USE:
ActionsEstLoader.py => 
    device : choose what you wanna use gpu(cuda) or cpu 
    weight_file : can change your own dataset
    self.class_names : pop up your Action recigintion
DetectorLoader.py =>
    conf_thres : confidence for the Action
main.py =>
    action_name : can appear the Action with other coloer
